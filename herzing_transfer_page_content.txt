When can I enter the US on my F-1 visa?

International students on an F-1 visa are not permitted to enter the USA more than 30 days before the start date of their program as listed on their Form I-20

What documents do I need to enter the US?

To enter the USA you will need a valid passport, visa and Form I-20. A visa does not guarantee entry into the United States. A visa only allows a foreign citizen to travel to a U.S. port-of-entry (generally an airport) and request permission to enter the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials at the port-of-entry have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States.

Am I able to work while attending school on my F-1 visa?

The opportunities to work in the USA as an international student are very limited. In most cases the only options to work while attending Herzing University are: during the internship in your final semester for authorized Curricular Practical Training (CPT) and after graduation after applying for and getting approved for Optional Practical Training (OPT).

Do I need a transcript evaluation?

Applicants that have attended college/university outside of the USA will require a 3rd party to complete a foreign credential evaluation. Herzing University will handle the evaluation process for you after we receive your official transcripts and your application for admissions is complete.

Do I need ACT/SAT/GMAT scores?

No, these exams are not required, but the ACT or SAT can be considered for admissions if you have already taken it.

Do you accept transfer students?

Yes! If you are attending another school, your I-20 is in good standing, and you meet the admissions requirements, we can admit you as a transfer student.

How many credits must I take to be full-time?

In order to be full time undergraduate students must take a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester. Graduate students must take a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester to be full time.

When can I take a vacation or holiday?

International students may take a semester break after completing 2 full time semesters. Students may not take a break if there is only 1 semester left until graduation.

How can a student’s family join them in the USA?

A student’s dependent family members may apply for an F-2 dependent visa if you would like your family to join you in the USA. Dependent family members include spouses and children only. If your dependent family members would like to apply, please contact your DSO for instructions on the process. F-2 visas are not guaranteed and must be applied for at the US Embassy.
